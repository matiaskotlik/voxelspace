# [Voxel Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel_Space) rendering algorithm in Rust

Rust/[ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) implementation of the Voxel Space algorithm from the Comanche games.

Maps are from https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/tree/master/maps

# How do I run this?

If you want to build it yourself you can just clone and `cargo run`.

Otherwise, GH Actions builds binaries for Windows, OSX, and Linux here: https://github.com/qmatias/voxelspace/releases/latest if that's more your style.
